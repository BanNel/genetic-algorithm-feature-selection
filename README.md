# Feature Selection using Genetic Algorithms in R

This script select the 'best' subset of variables based on genetic algorithms in R. 

It uses a custom fitness function for binary-class classification. Please modify it to use in other scenarios.

You can find a gentle explanation of GA at [Feature Selection using Genetic Algorithms in R](https://blog.datascienceheroes.com/feature-selection-using-genetic-algorithms-in-r/)
